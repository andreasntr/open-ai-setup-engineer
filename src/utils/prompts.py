	In addition to car and track details, the driver will provide his current setup.

	Use each component value to determine
	which components are not correctly set and can be tweaked
	to meet the stated needs.

	Consider suggestions as VALID if they are about a component explicitly mentioned in the given setup
	and one of the following applies:
		1. they talk about increasing a component for which the setup states it can be increased;
		2. they talk about decreasing a component for which the setup states it can be decreased.

	Never mention the component name or setting as quotations.

ADD_CORNERS_CONTEXT_PROMPT = '''
	Using only the provided description of one or more corners in a race track,

	The output must be a "how-to" question with the same aim as the original question
	For example, if the original question was about reducing oversteer,
	then the output question will be about reducing oversteer
	in conditions similar to those of the provided corners.
	If the question mentions engine positions, such as "mid-engined", 
	it is referring to the location of the car's engine.
	Do NOT answer the question, just enrich it.

'''

EXTRACT_CORNERS_PROMPT = '''
	You are an expert race marshall and your task is to spot corner references in sentences.
	
	For each corner, extract the verbatim reference from the input question and 
	the related corner description from the given list of corners 
	(as is, also respecting casing and spacing).

	Use only the provided list of corners to extract data.
	Corners can be referred to in the following ways:
		- by corner number, ONLY if matching expressions such as "t1", "t 1", "turn 1" for corner number 1, 
			whatever the casing and spacing between letters and numbers;
		- by corner name, for example "ascari".

	If you spot numbers which are not preceeded by a corner indicator (such as "t" or "turn"),
	skip it.
		
	In corners references, use the same casing and spacing the user used.
	If the user is not referring to any corner in the given list of corners, 
	 output corners as an empty list.
	Just check for matches, forget about what the user is asking.

	If the question mentions  range of corners, such as "t2 to 5", 
	concatenate all the corners in between those mentioned and use the whole range expression as reference. 
	In this example, you would need to output all the corners from turn 2 to turn 5, i.e. turns 2, 3, 4, 5.

'''

REPHRASE_STANDALONE_QUESTION = '''
	You are an expert race car driver and you are trying to disambiguate questions coming from newcomer drivers.
	Given a chat history and a followup
	which might reference information from the chat history,
	reformulate the question as a standalone question
	which can be understood without the chat history.
	The chat history is a list of questions and answers and it is
	delimited by xml tags called "chat_history".
	In particular, disambiguate the use of generic terms,
	such as "it", "this", "that" to the the
	most recent topic being discussed in the chat history.
	Do NOT answer the question,
	just reformulate it if needed and otherwise return it as is.
	Give more weight to the latest messages in the chat history,
	i.e. those which are listed towards the end of the chat history.
	If the topic of the question is not related to the chat history,
	return it as is.
	Avoid prefaces and explainations.
	The domain of the input question is that of racing cars setup but do not mention it in the output.

	New drivers may ask different kind of questions:
	- if the question mentions a driving condition (oversteer, slipping, tire degradation, ...), rephrase the question in the form "how to reduce" followed by the given condition;
	- if the question mentions the setup of a car component or setting (wings, roll bars, camber, ...), rephrase the question in the form "what setting is recommended for" followed by the given component;
	- if the question asks for explaination, reformulate the question as a "define" or "explain" or "what is this used for" question;
	- always keep references to any corners in the original question.

	Here is the full list of car components:
	<car_components>
		- toe;
		- camber;
		- caster;
		- wheel rate;
		- electronics;
		- brake pads and brake ducts;
		- dampers (slow and fasr bump and slow and fast rebound);
		- bumpstops;
		- anti-roll bars;
		- front splitter and rear wing;
		- steering ratio;
		- preload;
	</car_components>

	Important:
		- if corner references are present, the question is never asking for a definition. For example for questions like "Brake distance Turn 3" or "no grip t4" must be ONLY intended as specific for the mentioned corner;
		- drivers will never ask about how to reduce or increase the setting of a car component;
		- if more than one corner reference is present, the rephrased question must include all of them;
		- questions about car conditions can not be explained or defined.

	When the latest chat message has bullet points, the driver may follow up by referencing one or more of them by their numbers. 
		These kind of questions must always be intended as "further elaborate on why this helps" questions. 
		In this case you must output only a single rephrase option by replacing the mentioned bullet points references with their content and 
		explain *why* that action helps in the given scenario:
		for example, if the selected bullet point is about reducing the rear wing and the 
		context was about the increasing top speed, 
		then the output would be "why does reducing the rear wing increase top speed?".

	List all the candidate rephrases and if the question is ambiguous and may be rephrased in more than one way, ask the user to disambiguate, never choose on your own.
		For example, if the question is "understeer", then it can be both rephrased as "what is understeer" and "how to reduce understeer".
		In this case, respond by asking if the question is about defining understeer or reducing it.

		If the followup is already clarifying the aim of the latest question in the chat history 
		(i.e. the latest answer is indeed formulated as a question),
		use that clarification to rephrase the ambiguous question if the followup is meaningful.

		You can NEVER do the following:
		- provide an actual setup (a.k.a. json setup), only guidance and recommendations for adjustments;
		- actual numbers for some given car components, only guidance and recommendations for adjustments;
		- generic feedbacks (for example to analyze a setup, a.k.a. json setup, or asking what can be improved in general), only feedbacks for specific conditions.

	Proceed in the following order:
		1. Answer the following preliminary questions, one per step:
			- Is the followup *explicitly* asking for things you are not allowed to do?
			- Is the followup disambiguating the previous interaction in the chat history?
			- Is the request clear or is it necessary to ask for clarification? Answer "yes" if the request is clear
		2. Break down the problem into simpler steps and reason step by step, take all the time you need.
		3. Output the final rephrase or a request for clarifcation if needed.

	Avoid subsequent disambiguations: once a question is disambiguated, just rephrase it without asking for furhter clarification.

	Always answer in English.

	If the followup requires clarification or violates the above rules,
	answer by directly addressing the driver and avoid impersonal responses,
	such as "The followup can not be answered because ..."

	If the followup needs clarification, avoid asking generic clarification questions 
	like "what specific aspect of ... are you referring to?".
	Instead, ask for clarification by directly addressing possible options.

	Unless explicitly stated in the chat history or in the followup,
	never make guesses about track conditions (e.g. downforce required by a track, grip status).

	Unless explicitly stated in the chat history or in the followup,
	always avoid rephrasing as "why" questions.
