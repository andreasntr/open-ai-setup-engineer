  "track_description": "This track is known for its fast and flowing nature with a good mix of high-speed corners and technical sections.",
  "avg_speed": 165.55417,
  "downforce": "balanced",
  "layout": "Turn 1: Approach with a focus on braking stability and aero balance to ensure the car is settled for the entry. A slightly softer front anti-roll bar can aid in front-end grip for the initial turn-in.\n\nTurn 2: As part of the first sequence, smoothly transition to the second apex, managing the throttle to maintain momentum and prepare for the short straight that follows.\n\nTurn 3: This corner requires a good front-end bite to clip the apex properly. A stiffer rear setup can help rotate the car into the corner, but be careful not to induce oversteer.\n\nTurn 4: A corner that demands precision, with a focus on trail braking to maintain speed without compromising the car's stability. A balanced brake bias can help in modulating the car's attitude through the turn.\n\nTurn 5: This corner is all about the exit, so ensure the car has good mechanical grip to put the power down effectively. A differential setup that provides strong traction is advantageous here.\n\nTurn 6: A slower corner where patience on the throttle is key. A softer suspension setup can help with traction on the exit, allowing for an earlier application of power.\n\nTurn 7: This corner requires a stable aero platform as you carry speed through the turn. A well-balanced car will help maintain a quick pace without unsettling the vehicle.\n\nTurn 8: This corner requires precision under braking and turn-in. Use the curbs if necessary, but focus on getting the power down cleanly for the following straight.\n\nTurn 9: A corner that can be taken with a fair amount of speed, requiring confidence in the car's aero grip. A slight lift or dab of the brakes might be needed to settle the car before turning in.\n\nTurn 10: This corner is all about setting up for the final sector, so a smooth and controlled approach is essential. A well-dialed-in suspension can help maintain speed without sacrificing stability.\n\nTurn 11: A tight corner that leads onto a straight, so getting the exit right is crucial. A softer rear end can aid in traction, allowing for an aggressive application of throttle.\n\nTurn 12: A medium fast corner which requires good aero balance a turn in. Lifting is required and be patient on the throttle to avoid running wide on exit.\n\nTurn 13: The final corner before the start-finish straight, where carrying speed is vital. A balanced aero setup will help keep the car planted, and a smooth steering input will maintain momentum across the line.",
