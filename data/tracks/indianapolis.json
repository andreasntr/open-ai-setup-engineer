  "track_description": "The Indianapolis Motor Speedway - IndyCar Grand Prix Circuit is a road course with a mix of medium to high-speed corners and a long front straight. It requires a balance of downforce and straight-line speed.",
  "avg_speed": 150.25201,
  "downforce": "balanced",
  "layout": "Turn 1: This corner requires a high downforce setup for stability through the fast entry. Brake firmly and aim for a late apex to maintain speed onto the following straight. A softer front suspension can help with turn-in responsiveness.\n\nTurn 2: A quick flick to position the car for the next series of corners. Keep the throttle modulated and focus on setting up for the next turn.\n\nTurn 3: This tight corner demands precise braking and a good turn-in point. A softer rear anti-roll bar can aid in the car's rotation, allowing for a smoother corner exit.\n\nTurn 4: Another quick direction change, requiring a balanced car setup to maintain speed and control. Use the curbs if necessary, but ensure the car is stable for the best exit.\n\nTurn 5: A high-speed corner that leads into a heavy braking zone. Stiff dampers can help the car absorb the curbs without unsettling the vehicle too much.\n\nTurn 6: The entry to the chicane where braking stability and a precise turn-in are crucial. A stiffer rear setup can help with quick direction changes.\n\nTurn 7: The second part of the chicane, where carrying speed and setting up for the exit is key. Use the curbs to your advantage, but be mindful of track limits.\n\nTurn 8: A fast corner that requires confidence in the car's aero balance. A high downforce setup will help maintain speed through the corner.\n\nTurn 9: This corner demands a smooth and progressive brake application. A balanced setup will help maintain speed without compromising the exit.\n\nTurn 10: Focus on a smooth exit to carry speed onto the following straight. A differential that allows for good traction out of slow corners can be beneficial here.\n\nTurn 11: A tight corner where mechanical grip is crucial. Use a softer suspension setup to maximize traction on the exit. Brake early and turn in with patience, waiting for the right moment to get back on the power.\n\nTurn 12: The final corner requires a high downforce setup for stability through the fast entry. Brake firmly and aim for a late apex to maintain speed onto the main straight. A softer front suspension can help with turn-in responsiveness.",
