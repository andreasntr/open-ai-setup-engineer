  "track_description": "The Imola Grand Prix Circuit is known for its fast and flowing nature, with a mix of high-speed corners and elevation changes.",

  "downforce": "balanced",
  "layout": "Turn 1 (Tamburello): Approach this high-speed chicane with a stable aero setup to maintain control through the rapid direction changes. Brake firmly and downshift quickly, aiming to clip the apex of the first part of the chicane. The suspension should be stiff enough to handle the curbs but with enough compliance to avoid unsettling the car.\n\nTurn 2 (Tamburello): Immediately after the first part, smoothly transition to the second apex of Tamburello. Keep the throttle modulated and prepare for the exit, focusing on a clean drive out to carry speed onto the following straight.\n\nTurn 3 (Tamburello): The final part of the chicane requires a quick flick of the steering to position the car for the exit. Use the curbs if necessary, but be mindful of track limits.\n\nTurn 4 (Villeneuve): This chicane demands precise braking and turn-in points. A softer rear anti-roll bar can help with the quick left-right transition, ensuring the rear end stays planted.\n\nTurn 5 (Villeneuve): Trail brake into the second part of Villeneuve, balancing the car on the edge of grip. Accelerate out smoothly, avoiding excessive wheel spin.\n\nTurn 6 (Tosa): A tight corner where mechanical grip is crucial. Use a softer suspension setup to maximize traction on the uphill exit. Brake early and turn in with patience, waiting for the right moment to get back on the power.\n\nTurn 7 (Piratella): This downhill approach requires a high downforce setup for stability. Brake in a straight line before turning in, and be cautious with the throttle to prevent understeer or oversteer as the elevation changes.\n\nTurn 8 (Acque Minerali): The first part of this section is taken at high speed, so a stable front end is important. Trail brake into the corner and aim for a late apex to set up for the second part.\n\nTurn 9 (Acque Minerali): The second part tightens up, so a good exit is key. Use the curbs if necessary, but ensure the car is settled to maximize exit speed.\n\nTurns 10-11 (Variante Alta): A high curb chicane where stiff dampers can help the car absorb the shock without losing too much time. Brake straight and hard, then attack the curbs aggressively while keeping the car stable for the exit.\n\nTurn 12 (Rivazza 1): A downhill left-hander that requires a smooth and progressive brake application. A balanced setup will help maintain speed through the long corner without compromising the exit.\n\nTurn 13 (Rivazza 2): Focus on a smooth exit to carry speed onto the following straight. A differential that allows for good traction out of slow corners can be beneficial here.",
