  "track_description": "The Circuit Ricardo Tormo - Grand Prix Circuit is known for its combination of fast corners and technical sections, making it a challenging track for aerodynamic setup.",
  "avg_speed": 160.9026,
  "downforce": "balanced",
  "layout": "Turn 1: Approach with a high downforce setup for stability through the tight and technical sections. Brake late but smoothly, aiming to clip the apex while managing the car's weight transfer.\n\nTurn 2: Immediately after Turn 1, prepare for a quick direction change. A setup with responsive steering and a balanced chassis will aid in navigating this corner effectively.\n\nTurn 3: This corner demands precision. Use a softer suspension setting to help the car absorb the curbs without unsettling the balance. Aim for a tight line to set up for the next corner.\n\nTurn 4: A challenging corner that requires a good exit for the straight that follows. Focus on braking stability and a setup that allows for early throttle application without inducing too much oversteer.\n\nTurn 5: A high-speed corner that benefits from aero stability. Keep the car planted with a stiffer rear wing setting, ensuring you can carry as much speed as possible through the corner.\n\nTurn 6: This corner leads into a series of technical sections, so maintaining momentum is key. A setup that provides a good front-end response will help in making the quick direction changes smoothly.\n\nTurn 7: A tight corner requiring precise braking and a good turn-in point. Consider a softer rear anti-roll bar to help the car rotate without losing rear grip.\n\nTurn 8: Similar to Turn 7, but with an emphasis on the exit. A differential setup that maximizes traction will aid in accelerating out of the corner effectively.\n\nTurn 9: A fast corner that leads onto a straight. Aero balance is crucial here to keep the car stable at high speeds. Minimize steering inputs to maintain speed.\n\nTurn 10: Braking stability is key for this corner. A setup that allows for late braking and stable turn-in will help in navigating this corner efficiently.\n\nTurn 11: This corner requires a good balance between mechanical grip and aero efficiency. Use a setup that allows for a smooth transition from braking to acceleration, focusing on the exit to carry speed onto the straight.\n\nTurn 12: A high-speed corner that demands confidence in the car's aero package. Stiffen the suspension slightly to maintain stability through the corner.\n\nTurn 13: The final corner before the main straight. A good exit is crucial, so focus on a setup that allows for early throttle application, using a differential that provides strong traction out of slow corners.",
