  "downforce": "low",
  "layout": "Turn 1 (La Source): This is a hairpin where braking stability and low-speed traction are crucial. Opt for a softer front anti-roll bar to aid turn-in and a differential setup that maximizes traction on the exit.\n\nTurn 2 (Eau Rouge): Setup is critical here for maintaining full throttle through the uphill compression. A stable aero balance and stiff suspension will help keep the car planted, but be prepared to lift slightly if the car gets unsettled.\n\nTurn 3 (Raidillon): As the continuation of Eau Rouge, carry the speed through and focus on the exit line as it leads onto the Kemmel Straight. Confidence in the car's stability is key.\n\nTurns 4-5 (Les Combes): This is a heavy braking zone into a chicane. Strong front-end grip is needed for the initial turn-in, and a stable rear is crucial for the quick direction change.\n\nTurn 6 (Malmedy): Exiting Les Combes, carry the momentum and use a late apex for Malmedy to ensure a good exit speed down the following straight.\n\nTurn 7 (Bruxelles): A long, downhill right-hander that tightens on exit. Trail braking helps to rotate the car, and a softer rear setup can aid in maintaining grip throughout the corner.\n\nTurn 8 (Speakers' Corner): A quick corner that requires precision. Maintain a balanced aero setup to keep the car stable through the fast turn.\n\nTurn 9 (Pouhon): A high-speed, double-apex left-hander that demands high downforce for stability and confidence. Minimize steering input to maintain speed and avoid scrubbing off too much through the corner.\n\nTurn 10 (Pouhon): The second apex of Pouhon is crucial for a good exit. Keep the car balanced and aim for a smooth application of the throttle to carry speed onto the following section.\n\nTurns 11-12 (Pif-Paf): This chicane requires a car that can change direction quickly. A stiffer setup may be beneficial, but ensure the car remains compliant enough to deal with the curbs.\n\nTurn 13 (Campus): A corner that follows immediately after the chicane. Keep the car settled and focus on a clean exit to maximize speed onto the following short straight.\n\nTurn 14 (Stavelot): The first part of Stavelot is taken with a focus on setting up for the second part. Use a late apex and prepare for a strong exit.\n\nTurn 15 (Stavelot): The second part is all about the exit as it leads onto the long, full-throttle section of the track. A good differential setup will help put the power down effectively.\n\nTurn 16 (Blanchimont): A very fast corner where aerodynamic efficiency and stability are key. Keep the steering inputs smooth and the throttle controlled to maintain speed through the corner.\n\nTurns 17-18 (Bus Stop Chicane): The final chicane is a heavy braking zone where late braking and strong front-end grip are essential. Attack the curbs but be ready to stabilize the car quickly for the exit onto the start-finish straight.",
