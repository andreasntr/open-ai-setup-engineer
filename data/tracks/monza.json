  "length": 5.793,
  "track_description": "This track is known for its long straights which require cars to use very low drag.",
  "avg_speed": 197.63461,
  "downforce": "low",
  "layout": "Turn 1 (Rettifilo Tribune): This is a heavy braking zone where you'll need to downshift rapidly while maintaining stability. A strong front brake bias can help, but ensure the rear doesn't become unsettled. Hit the first apex curb, but be ready to quickly switch to the second part of the chicane.\n\nTurn 2 (Rettifilo Tribune): As you exit the first part, balance the throttle and aim to clip the second apex. Suspension should be set to absorb the curbs without unsettling the car too much.\n\nTurn 3 (Curva Biassono): This is a fast corner where aerodynamic efficiency is key. Keep the car as flat as possible, with a setup that minimizes drag while providing enough downforce for stability.\n\nTurn 4 (Variante della Roggia): Brake decisively and downshift while approaching this chicane. The suspension should be able to handle the curbs, so a medium stiffness might be optimal. Clip the first apex and prepare for the immediate right-hand part of the chicane.\n\nTurn 5 (Variante della Roggia): After the left-hand entry, quickly switch to the right, using the curbs if necessary. A well-balanced car is crucial to maintain speed and control through this section.\n\nTurn 6 (Curva di Lesmo 1): A downforce-dependent corner that requires a stable rear end. Brake early and turn in smoothly, focusing on hitting the apex and maintaining momentum through the corner.\n\nTurn 7 (Curva di Lesmo 2): Similar to the first Lesmo, but with a slightly later apex. Patience on the throttle is key to avoid understeer and to set up for a good exit.\n\nTurn 8 (Curva Serraglio): This is a slight bend that leads into the Ascari chicane. Maintain a smooth line and keep the car settled as you prepare for the heavy braking zone ahead.\n\nTurn 9 (Variante Ascari): A complex series of corners that starts with a fast left. Brake and turn in with confidence, using a setup that allows for quick direction changes without losing grip.\n\nTurn 10 (Variante Ascari): The middle part of Ascari is a quick right-hander. Keep the car balanced and aim for a tight line to set up for the final part of the chicane.\n\nTurn 11 (Variante Ascari): The last part of Ascari is a left that requires a good exit to maximize speed onto the back straight. Use the curbs if necessary, but ensure the car is stable for the acceleration zone.\n\nTurn 12 (Curva Parabolica): A crucial corner for lap time, as it leads onto the main straight. A softer suspension setup can help maintain traction through the long, sweeping turn. Brake smoothly, turn in, and gradually apply the throttle to carry as much speed as possible onto the straight.",
