  "downforce": "high",
  "layout": "Turn 1: This is a heavy braking zone where you'll need to downshift quickly while maintaining stability. A setup with strong front-end grip is beneficial to prevent understeer. It's important to get the power down early but smoothly to maintain momentum up the hill.\n\nTurn 2: Trail brake into this down-hill and focus on positioning the car for the next turn rather than outright speed here.\n\nTurn 3: This is a less pronounced corner that sets up for the following sequence. It must be taken flat out but requires good downforce to avoid running wide. You can use the inside curb.\n\nTurn 4: A tight corner that requires patience. Wait until you see the exit before getting back on the throttle to avoid running wide.\n\nTurn 5: This corner begins a challenging sequence of turns. A balanced aero package will help you maintain speed through the continuous changes in direction.\n\nTurn 6: The first corner of this slow chicane is all about preparing for the next corner. Keep the car balanced and aim for a smooth transition and use the curb on entry.\n\nTurn 7: The last in the sequence, this corner requires a good exit to set up for the following straight. Use the curbs if necessary, but be mindful of the car's stability.\n\nTurn 8: A slow and tight corner where traction is key. A softer rear suspension can help with the mechanical grip needed for the uphill exit.\n\nTurn 9: This corner is taken in quick succession after Turn 8. Focus on a clean exit to maximize speed down the next straight.\n\nTurn 10: A high-speed corner that can be tricky to nail. A stable rear end is crucial to carry speed through and onto the following section.\n\nTurn 11: This corner leads onto a short straight, so a good exit is crucial. Balance the car's setup to ensure you can get on the power early without losing the rear.\n\nTurn 12: A fast corner that requires confidence. A setup with good downforce will help keep the car planted through the turn.\n\nTurn 13: This corner is all about positioning for the final turn. Ensure the car is stable under braking and aim for a clean line through.\n\nTurn 14: The final corner before the start-finish straight. A good exit is essential here, so focus on getting the power down cleanly and driving out onto the straight with as much speed as possible.",
