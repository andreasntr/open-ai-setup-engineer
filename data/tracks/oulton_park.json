  "layout": "Turn 1 (Old Hall Corner): This is a crucial corner for setting up a good lap. A balanced aero setup is important to maintain speed through the corner while still being able to brake effectively for the chicane that follows. Trail braking can help rotate the car into the apex, and getting on the throttle early will set you up for a good run down the following straight.\n\nTurn 2 (Dentons): This is a slight kink that leads into the Cascades corner. It's important to keep the car stable and well-positioned on the track to set up for the next turn.\n\nTurn 3 (Cascades): A fast, flowing corner that requires commitment and precision. A stable rear end will help carry speed through the corner, and a smooth application of the throttle on exit will maximize speed onto the Lakeside straight.\n\nTurn 4 (Island Bend): This is a high-speed corner where aerodynamic efficiency is key. Keep the steering inputs smooth and maintain a high minimum speed to carry momentum onto the Shell Oils Corner.\n\nTurn 5 (Shell Oils Corner): A banked hairpin that allows for a higher speed approach. A softer suspension setup can help with the camber of the corner, and getting the power down early is crucial for a good run towards the Britten's chicane.\n\nTurns 6-7 (Britten's): This chicane requires heavy braking and a nimble car to navigate the tight left-right sequence. Stiff dampers can help the car to quickly settle after hitting the curbs, allowing for a faster transition and exit speed.\n\nTurns 8-9 (Hislop's): This is a chicane where steering precision and agility are keys, and a good exit will set you up for a faster approach to the next corner.\n\nTurn 10 (Knickerbrook): It's important to carry the momentum from Hislop's through this corner. Use the curbs if necessary, but be mindful of the car's balance and track limits.\n\nTurn 11 (Clay Hill): A fast and flowing section of the track that requires a good aero balance to maintain high speed. Keep the car stable and aim for a smooth line to carry speed through to the next corner.\n\nTurn 12 (Druids): A double-apex corner that demands a good front-end grip to turn in sharply. A softer front anti-roll bar may help with the initial turn-in, and patience on the throttle will ensure a strong exit towards Lodge Corner.\n\nTurn 13 (Lodge Corner): The final corner before the start-finish straight. A good exit is crucial here, so focus on hitting the late apex and getting on the power as early as possible without inducing too much wheelspin. A differential setup that provides good traction will be beneficial here.\n\nTurn 14 (Deer Leap): This is not so much a corner as it is a slight rise leading onto the start-finish straight. Keep the car planted and use the full width of the track to carry as much speed as possible across the line.",
