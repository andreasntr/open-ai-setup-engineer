  "length": 4.779,
  "track_description": "This track is known for its fast, flowing corners and long straights, making it a challenging circuit for high-speed stability and aerodynamic efficiency.",
  "avg_speed": 164.74576,
  "downforce": "balanced",
  "layout": "Turn 1 (Riches): This is a fast corner where aero balance is crucial for maintaining high speed while turning. Brake lightly and aim to carry as much speed as possible through the corner, setting up for the straight that follows.\n\nTurn 2 (Montreal): A heavy braking zone into a hairpin requires a stable front end to avoid understeer. Use a higher brake bias to ensure the car turns in effectively. Patience on the throttle is key to avoid wheel spin on exit.\n\nTurn 3 (Palmer): A medium-speed corner that demands a good front grip for a late apex. Trail braking can help rotate the car into the corner, and smooth throttle application is necessary to maintain traction on exit.\n\nTurn 4 (Agostini): Another hairpin where mechanical grip is essential. A softer suspension setup can aid in maximizing traction, especially on the exit where the track opens up.\n\nTurn 5 (Hamilton): A quick corner that requires confidence in the car's balance. Minimize steering input to maintain speed and set up for the next corner.\n\nTurn 6 (Oggies): A corner that tightens on exit, requiring a careful approach to throttle application. A differential setup that allows for progressive power delivery will help in putting down the power effectively.\n\nTurn 7 (Williams): A fast corner leading onto the Bentley Straight. Aero efficiency is important here to carry speed onto the straight, so focus on a smooth steering input and a clean exit.\n\nTurn 8 (Brundle): The first part of a complex sequence at the end of the Bentley Straight. Brake firmly and downshift while being prepared to turn in sharply, using the curbs if necessary but keeping the car stable for the next part.\n\nTurn 9 (Nelson): Immediately after Brundle, this corner requires a quick direction change. Keep the car balanced and aim for a smooth transition to maintain momentum.\n\nTurn 10 (Bomb Hole): A corner with a compression that can unsettle the car. A setup with compliant dampers can help absorb the forces and maintain stability through the turn.\n\nTurn 11 (Coram): A long, sweeping corner that tests the aero balance of the car. Maintain a steady throttle and use the full width of the track to carry speed through the corner.\n\nTurn 12 (Murrays): The final corner is a slow one, leading onto the start-finish straight. Mechanical grip is again important here, so focus on a clean exit to maximize acceleration down the straight.",
