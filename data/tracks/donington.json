  "track_description": "The Donington Park Grand Prix Circuit is known for its fast and flowing nature, with a mix of high-speed corners and technical sections. It requires a good balance of downforce and top speed for optimal performance.",

  "downforce": "balanced",
  "layout": "Turn 1 (Redgate): This corner requires a precise turn-in point and a setup that allows for a stable front end under braking. Trail brake into the corner and aim for a late apex to maximize exit speed onto the following straight.\n\nTurn 2 (Hollywood): A fast section where aerodynamic efficiency is crucial. Keep the car balanced and use the natural flow of the track to carry speed through the corner.\n\nTurn 3 (Craner Curves): This is a series of flowing corners taken at high speed. A setup with good high-speed stability is essential. Use the downforce to your advantage and keep steering inputs smooth to maintain momentum.\n\nTurn 4 (Old Hairpin): A challenging corner that requires a good front grip for turn-in and a stable rear for the exit. Brake early and focus on hitting the late apex to ensure a strong exit.\n\nTurns 5-6 (Starkey's Bridge and Schwartz Curve): This is a transitional section where maintaining a smooth line is key. Keep the car settled and prepare for the upcoming corner.\n\nTurn 7 (McLeans): A corner that demands a good mechanical grip. Use a softer suspension setup to help the car turn into the uphill section. Brake in a straight line and turn in with confidence, getting back on the power as early as possible.\n\nTurn 8 (Coppice): A double-apex right-hander that requires patience. Wait for the car to settle before turning in for the second apex, and then focus on a smooth throttle application to maximize exit speed onto the back straight.\n\nTurns 9-10 (Fogarty Esses): A chicane that can be taken aggressively if the car is set up with stiff dampers to handle the curbs. Brake straight and hard, then carry as much speed as possible through the chicane while setting up for the next corner.\n\nTurn 11 (Melbourne Hairpin): A tight hairpin where braking stability and traction on exit are crucial. A softer rear end can help rotate the car into the corner, but be careful with the throttle to avoid wheel spin on exit.\n\nTurn 11 (Goddards): The final corner leading onto the start-finish straight. A balanced aero setup will help maintain speed through the corner, and a differential setup for good traction will aid in putting the power down effectively as you cross the line.",
